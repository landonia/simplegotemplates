# simplegotemplates

A simple template library written using the Go Language.

## Overview

The simple go blog system uses only the base packages contained within Go for creating a simple template
handler. You can provide it with a list of templates that you want to handle within your application and
set a flag to determine whether in development or production mode. If in development mode the templates will
be refreshed on each call meaning that you do not have to keep restarting the application. When in production
mode, the templates will be compiled once.

## Maturity

This is my first application written using the Go Language and therefore you should expect
some bugs. 

## Installation

With a healthy Go Language installed, simply run `go get github.com/landonia/simplegotemplates/templates`
